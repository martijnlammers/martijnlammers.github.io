For 25 days long, a new puzzle with varying difficulty is unlocked. These challenges are an excellent excersise for  learning new programming languages and honing problem solving skills. </p> <p>Participate or learn more here: adventofcode.com</p> <p><code>Programming languages</code></p> <pre><code>Rust\n</code></pre> <p><code>Frameworks, libraries</code></p> <pre><code>N/A\n</code></pre> <p><code>Development tools</code></p> <pre><code>Git\n</code></pre> <p></p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"games/","title":"Games OpenGL Rubix Cube","text":"<ul> <li> <p>              Repository: Python Rubix Cube </p> &gt;DescriptionToolingVisuals <p>This project originated as an assignment for my computer graphics course, which got  afterwork love since I thought it was a cool. The Rubix Cube is created out of 27 cube objects. The cube objects consist of 6 polygons with different colours. After creation, the cube is translated into the right position.</p> <p>When you rotate a slice, it'll replace the old cube colours with new cube colours.  Doing this was easier than rotating a layer, although I might consider doing this in the  future.</p> <p>After the rubix cube and colours are set in place, a light source was added. The small cubes were made slightly clear in order to give them a glassy effect.</p> <p><code>Programming languages</code></p> <pre><code>Python\n</code></pre> <p><code>Frameworks, libraries</code></p> <pre><code>OpenGL\n</code></pre> <p><code>Development tools</code></p> <pre><code>Git\n</code></pre> <p></p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"machine_learning/","title":"Machine Learning","text":""},{"location":"simulations/","title":"Simulations","text":""},{"location":"tools/","title":"Tools","text":""}]}

    === "Description"
        This website has been built using [Material MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) as it has
        clean 'out of the box' styling, powerful functionalities, supports both desktop and mobile viewports, and generates static files
        for GitHub pages. By using Material MkDocs, it grants me to focus myself on the content of the portfolio while retaining 
        a quality site.

        The portfolio holds a collection of my previously built projects. It was mainly built to look back at my own artifacts, but is also used to show others what kind of things I'm capable of building.

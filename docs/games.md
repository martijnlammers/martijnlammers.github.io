    === "Description"
        
        This project originated as an assignment for my computer graphics course, which got 
        afterwork love since I thought it was a cool. The Rubix Cube
        is created out of 27 cube objects.
        The cube objects consist of 6 polygons with different colours.
        After creation, the cube is translated into the right position.

        When you rotate a slice, it'll replace the old cube colours with new cube colours. 
        Doing this was easier than rotating a layer, although I might consider doing this in the 
        future.

        After the rubix cube and colours are set in place, a light source was added.
        The small cubes were made slightly clear in order to give them a glassy effect.

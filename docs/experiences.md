    Teledyne GAVIA is an automatic underwater vessel (AUV) used for hydrographic surveying up to 1000 meters in depth. Using various sensors, the AUV can map the features of an underwater area for military, commercial or scientific applications. What makes this AUV so awesome, is that the AUV is modular, meaning the onboard sensors, batteries, or payload capacity can be changed as desired.

    Teledyne RESON provides a range of hard- and software solutions for applications such as
    hydrography, civil engineering and dredging, defense & security, as well as marine research. 
    
    They are a recognized brand 
    within the domain for their excellent acoustic measurement instruments like the SeaBat or Hydrosweep multibeam echosounders,
    and Teledyne PDS software for surveying, data processing and dredge guidance.

=== "PDS Maintenance"
    PDS is a huge software package primarily used for dredging and hydrographic purposes.

    Teledyne GAVIA - a sister company of RESON - has a serie of automatic underwater vessels (AUVs), which can be used for hydrographic surveying. Various sensors such as side scan sonar or multibeam echosounders make it possible for the AUV to map the features of an underwater area for military, commercial or scientific applications. The modularity of the vessel gives it its ability to change onboard sensors, batteries, or payload capacity as desired.

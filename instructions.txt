Hello person whoever decides to use my Rubix Cube.

As you might can tell, I have not implemented this intructional card in the program itself.
I didn't ended up having sufficient time implementing text on a rectangle, so I just decided 
ignore it and focus on other things. I did made this quick text file in order to give you some quick
instructions on the program I've created.

-------------------
	DESCRIPTION
-------------------
*Note requires PyOpenGL

The cube is created out of 27 small cube objects.
These cube objects consist of 6 polygons with colours created on different coordinates.
1 polygon is shaped to be a square.
After a small cube is created, they're translated into the right position.

When you rotate a slice, it'll replace the old cube colours with new cube colours. 
Doing this is miles easier than rotating the whole small cube.
(First implementation did try rotating the whole slice in order to create)

After the rubix cube and colours are set in place, a light source was added,
the small cubes became slightly clear in order to give them a glassy effect and 
the keybinds were set in place.
